In my opinion the following questions are the most important question in the data set.

1) How long does the average trip take.

2) Is the trip duration affected by weather( months/seasons).

3) Does the trip duration depend upon if a user is a subscriber or customer.

PART 1
UNIVARIATE EXPLORATION

Evaluating Question 1) How long does the average trip take.


CONCLUSION 1

** Majority of population uses the bikes for small time duration which is 10 minute.

Evaluating Question 2) In which decade most ford bike used.

CONCLUSION 2

** The population who have birth year between 1980 and 1990 uses the ford bike most

PART 2

BIVARIENT EXPLORATION

Evaluating Question 3) Is the trip duration affected by weather( months/seasons).

** Summer have the highest trip duration with 14.92. However fall have the lowest trip duration of 13.66

CONCLUSION 3

The weather does affect trip duration, but the affect is very limited. Unlike cities like Boston, New York,
which have very different four seasons, the weather in SF does not change that much.

Evaluating Question 4) Which gender used most ford bike.

CONCLUSION 4

** Male uses more than twice ford bike as compared to the female While other uses less number of ford bike as compared to male and female.

PART 3

MULTIVARIENT EXPLORATION


CONCLUSION 5

1) From the above two plot we conclude that there are far more customers than subscribers. The user type does 
   make an impact on trip duration.

2) The most important point about the subscribers is that they rent the bikes for long trips, above 300 minutes.

Summary of findings :

Since the trip duration has a close relationship with bike share company's revenue, I tried to find out what are 
the key factors affect trip duration. It turns out that Weather does not have a big effect on the trip duration 
but user type does have an impact on trip duration. According the analysis, I found subscribers tend to rend the
bikes for longer trips ( generally above 300 minutes ). One possible way to increase revenue is to attract more
potential customers and convert more exiting customers to subscribers.
